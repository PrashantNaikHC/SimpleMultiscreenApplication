    <string name="rap_god_lyrics">Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings\n
But Im only going to get this one chance\n
Somethings wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, youre on)\n
Just a feeling Ive got, like somethings about to happen, but I dont know what\n
If that means, what I think it means, were in trouble, big trouble,\n
And if he is as bananas as you say, Im not taking any chances\n
You were just what the doctor ordered\n
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\n
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\n
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\n
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot\n
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes\n
I got a laptop in my back pocket\n
My penll go off when I half-cock it\n
Got a fat knot from that rap profit\n
Made a living and a killing off it\n
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office\n
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack\n
Im an MC still as honest\n
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill em all with)\n
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop\n
You dont really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy brat\n
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, backpack rap crap, yep, yackidy-yac\n
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing\n
That Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table\n
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\n
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact\n
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack\n
Rappers are having a rough time period, heres a Maxipad\n
Its actually disastrously bad\n
For the wack while Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece as\n
Im beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\n
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\n
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\n
Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard, that hard\n
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got\n
Well, to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance\n
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance\n
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since\n
MCs get taken to school with this music\n
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme\n
Now I lead a new school full of students\n
Me? Im a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-\n
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\n
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position\n
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin Rock n
Roll Hall of Fame\n
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\n
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\n
On the wall of shame\n
You fags think its all a game til I walk a flock of flames\n
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?\n
Little gay looking boy\n
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy\n
You witnessing a mass occur\n
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy\n
Oy vey, that boys gay, thats all they say looking boy\n
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back\n
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy\n
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?\n
I got a hell yeah from Dre looking boy\n
Imma work for everything I have\n
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy\n
Basically boy youre never gonna be capable\n
To keep up with the same pace looking boy\n
Cause Im beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\n
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\n
The way Im racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar\n
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\n
Kneel before General Zod this planets Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard\n
So you be Thor and Ill be Odin, you rodent, Im omnipotent\n
Let off then Im reloading immediately with these bombs Im totin\n
And I should not be woken\n
Im the walking dead, but Im just a talking head, a zombie floating\n
But I got your mom deep throating\n
Im out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle\n
Im a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil\n
Its me, my honestys brutal\n
But its honestly futile if I dont utilize what I do though\n
For good at least once in a while\n
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\n
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times\n
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned\n
Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime\n
I know there was a time where once I\n
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind\n
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\n
Appeal with the skin color of mine\n
You get too big and here they come trying to\n
Censor you like that one line I said on Im Back from the Mathers LP\n
One when I tried to say Ill take seven kids from Columbine\n
Put em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\n
See if I get away with it now that I aint as big as I was, but Im\n
Morphin into an immortal coming through the portal\n
Youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though\n
And I dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for\n
Youre pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\n
You write normal, fuck being normal\n
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future\n
Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether\’s pad\n
Singin to a man while they played piano\n
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\n
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n
Hey, Fab, Imma kill you\n
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)\n
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming Im a human\n
What I gotta do to get it through to you Im superhuman\n
Innovative and Im made of rubber\n
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you\n
Im devastating, more than ever demonstrating\n
How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating\n
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\n
For the day that they can say I fell off, theyd be celebrating\n
Cause I know the way to get em motivated\n
I make elevating music, you make elevator music\n
Oh, hes too mainstream\n
Well, thats what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n
Its not hip hop, its pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\n
With rock, shock rap with Doc\n
Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it\n
I dont know how to make songs like that\n
I dont know what words to use\n
Let me know when it occurs to you\n
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\n
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin you\n
How many verses I gotta murder to\n
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\n
School flunkie, pill junky\n
But look at the accolades the skills brung me\n
Full of myself, but still hungry\n
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to\n
And Im a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\n
But its still tongue in cheek, fuck you\n
Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, Im asleep in the front seat\n
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\n
But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling\n
Angels fight with devils and, heres what they want from me\n
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\n
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\n
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\n
And understand the discrimination\n
But fuck it, lifes handing you lemons, make lemonade then\n
But if I cant batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\n
Dont mistake it for Satan\n
Its a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\n
And take a vacation to trip a broad\n
And make her fall on her face and dont be a retard\n
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?</string>

    <string name="boulevard_of_broken_dreams_lyrics">I walk a lonely road\n
The only one that I have ever known\n
Dont know where it goes\n
But its only me, and I walk alone\n
I walk this empty street\n
On the boulevard of broken dreams\n
Where the city sleeps\n
And Im the only one, and I walk alone\n
I walk alone, I walk alone\n
I walk alone and I walk a\n
My shadows the only one that walks beside me\n
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating\n
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me\n
Till then I walk alone\n
Ah ah ah ah ah\n
Ah ah ah ah ah\n
Im walking down the line\n
That divides me somewhere in my mind\n
On the border line of the edge\n
And where I walk alone\n
Read between the lines\n
Whats fucked up and every things all right\n
Check my vital signs to know Im still alive\n
And I walk alone\n
I walk alone, I walk alone\n
I walk alone and I walk a\n
My shadows the only one that walks beside me\n
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating\n
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me\n
Till then I walk alone\n
Ah ah ah ah ah\n
Ah ah ah ah ah\n
I walk alone, I walk a\n
I walk this empty street\n
On the boulevard of broken dreams\n
Where the city sleeps\n
And Im the only one, and I walk alone\n
My shadows the only one that walks beside me\n
My shallow hearts the only thing thats beating\n
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me\n
Till then I walk alone\n</string>

    <string name="beat_it_lyrics">They told him dont you ever come around here\n
Dont want to see your face, you better disappear\n
The fires in their eyes and their words are really clear\n
So beat it, just beat it\n
You better run, you better do what you can\n
Dont want to see no blood, dont be a macho man\n
You want to be tough, better do what you can\n
So beat it, but you want to be bad\n
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it\n
No one wants to be defeated\n
Showin how funky and strong is your fight\n
It doesnt matter whos wrong or right\n
Just beat it, beat it\n
Just beat it, beat it\n
Just beat it, beat it\n
Just beat it, beat it\n
Theyre out to get you, better leave while you can\n
Dont want to be a boy, you want to be a man\n
You want to stay alive, better do what you can\n
So beat it, just beat it\n
You have to show them that youre really not scared\n
Youre playin with your life, this aint no truth or dare\n
Theyll kick you, then they beat you,\n
Then theyll tell you its fair\n
So beat it, but you want to be bad\n
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it\n
No one wants to be defeated\n
Showin how funky and strong is your fight\n
It doesnt matter whos wrong or right\n
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it\n
No one wants to be defeated\n
Showin how funky and strong is your fight\n
It doesnt matter whos wrong or right\n
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it\n
No one wants to be defeated\n
Showin how funky and strong is your fight\n
It doesnt matter whos wrong or right\n
Just beat it, beat it\n
Beat it, beat it, beat it\n
No one wants to be defeated\n
Showin how funky and strong is your fight\n
It doesnt matter whos wrong or whos right\n
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it\n
No one wants to be defeated\n
Showin how funky and strong is your fight\n
It doesnt matter whos wrong or right\n
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it\n
No one wants to be defeated\n
Showin how funky and strong is your fight\n
It doesnt matter whos wrong or right\n
Just beat it, beat it\n
Beat it, beat it, beat it\n</string>
